## Purpose

**Key objectives:**
- Identify issues or gaps in security to secure assets of an organization.  
- Determine what security measures are in place and what can be improved.

## Scenario
Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, storefront, and warehouse for their products.  

However, Botium Toys’ online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide.  

The IT manager has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She is concerned about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets.  

The manager is also interested in ensuring compliance with regulations related to:  
- Internally processing and accepting online payments  
- Conducting business in the European Union (E.U.)  

To start, the IT manager:  
- Implements the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)  
- Establishes an audit scope and goals  
- Lists assets currently managed by the IT department  
- Completes a risk assessment
