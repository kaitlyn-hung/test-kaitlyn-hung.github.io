# Internal Security Audit

## Purpose
Audits help ensure that security checks are made, to monitor for threats, risks, or vulnerabilities that can affect an organization’s business continuity and critical assets. It is a review of an organization’s security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations and can provide an overview of the risk and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

## Scenario
Toys & Toys is a growing U.S. toy company with one physical location serving as its main office, warehouse, and storefront. With a rapidly expanding consumer base and increasing digital operations, the IT manager has initiated an internal audit to strengthen security, maintain compliance, and support continued growth. The audit applies the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to assess risks, review existing controls, and ensure compliance with payment processing and E.U. business regulations.
